## What is "How Hard Can It Be"

The "How Hard Can It Be" channel was started because of that exact question, how hard can it be? 

I undertake lots and lots of different projects because I'm hooked on learning and exploring whats possible. I ALWAYS under estimate how hard and or how long something will take, and some of my projects just fail. The majority however succeed, eventually, and I thought it would be fun to document and share these projects to help others, just like others have helped me.  

I have personally used and benefited from many different contributors on YouTube, reddit,  and was interested to understand how its done
