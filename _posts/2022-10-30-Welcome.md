The "How Hard Can It Be" YouTube channel was started because of that exact question, how hard can it be?

I undertake lots and lots of different projects because I'm hooked on learning and exploring whats possible. I ALWAYS under estimate how hard and or how long something will take, and some of my projects just fail. The majority however succeed, eventually, and I thought it would be fun to document and share these projects to help others, just like others have helped me.  

I have personally used and benefited from many different contributors on YouTube, reddit, and was interested to understand how its done. Whilst completing and documenting my own projects, if people are interested, we will post content from other contributors and help with post production.
